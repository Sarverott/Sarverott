# HELLO WORLD!

I like technology, reading about its details and observing its vulnerabilities. I program by vocation, the open source mission inspired me to publish my works. I do not limit myself to specific environments and languages. Over the years, programming has become my form of self-expression. I hope that you find my work usefull.
